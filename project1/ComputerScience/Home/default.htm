 Instructor refers to a faculty member, teaching assistant, or teaching fellow
in charge of the section in which an alleged violation of this Academic Honesty Policy
has occurred. Such individuals will normally be the instructor of record of the course
section in question. In instances where this is not the case, instances of alleged cheating
shall be reported to the supervisor (e.g., laboratory supervisor) of the instructor, as well
as the chair.

This is something about student.
The university can best
function and accomplish its objectives in an atmosphere of high ethical standards. It expects
and encourages all students, faculty and staff to contribute to such an atmosphere in every way
possible and especially by observing all accepted principles of academic honesty. It is
recognized, however, that any university will include a few students who do not understand,
appreciate, and practice these principles. As a consequence, alleged cases of academic
dishonesty will inevitably occur, and students will be accused. The following procedures are
designed to handle these cases in fairness to all concerned: the accused student, the faculty,
and the university.
Matters relating to academic honesty are within the general jurisdiction of the Provost and Vice
President for Academic Affairs.
The policy on academic honesty applies to all schools within the university. Specific jurisdiction
in academic honesty matters rests in each school of the university. The school with jurisdiction
is determined by the course in which dishonesty occurs. If the student involved majors in a
school other than that offering the course, the school offering the course has jurisdiction, but
the dean of the student's major school will be informed. If the school with jurisdiction cannot
be determined from the relationship between the alleged actions of a student or group of
students and a particular course, then the provost will designate which has jurisdiction. All
questions regarding the applicability of school or university policy or special provisions of
either shall be determined finally by the provost.
